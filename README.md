# Weather App

**Link to project:** https://hddev8.github.io/weather-app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

Weather data displayed using OpenWeatherMap's API

## Optimizations:

The current design leaves much to be desired. In addition to improving the look, I'd like to add forecast data, air pollution data, and weather maps.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to fetch data from an API.
